## Miscellaneous

> The thought process of intelligent creatures is mostly represented via inner language,
> just like how people would subconsciously read to themselves when looking at words and form thoughts that way.  
> If we can skip that step of information transmission and instead link up our consciousness,
> convert the codes of our inner language, then let the receiver's language system analyze and restore the information;
> we will have no barriers in communication.
